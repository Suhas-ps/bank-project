<h2><a class="anchor" id="analysis--key-findings"></a>📌 Analysis & Key Findings</h2>

- **Suspicious transactions are a key risk area**, with **20.43K high-risk transactions**, highlighting the need for focused monitoring.

- **Monthly transaction volume is stable** across most periods (**8.8K – 9.3K transactions**), with a sharp drop in the final month.

- **Transaction methods are evenly distributed**, with Debit Card, Credit Card, and Bank Transfer each contributing roughly **one-third** of total volume.

- **A few branches contribute the majority of transaction value**, indicating concentration at key locations.

- **Repayment behavior is largely healthy**, with **71% on-time repayments**, while late payments account for the remaining share.
