<h2><a class="anchor" id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

- Reviewed distribution of credit and debit transactions  
- Analyzed transaction volume trends across time periods  
- Evaluated month-over-month transaction movement  
- Identified periods with noticeable growth and decline patterns

<h2><a class="anchor" id="analysis--key-findings"></a>📌 Analysis & Key Findings</h2>

- Suspicious transactions are a key risk area, with 20.43K high-risk transactions, highlighting the need for focused monitoring.  
- Monthly transaction volume is stable across most periods (8.8K–9.3K transactions), with a sharp drop in the final month.  
- Transaction methods are evenly distributed, with Debit Card, Credit Card, and Bank Transfer each contributing roughly one-third of total volume.  
- A few branches contribute the majority of transaction value, indicating concentration at key locations.  
- Repayment behavior is largely healthy, with 71% on-time repayments, while late payments account for the remaining share.
